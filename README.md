Data Cleaning and Transformation Project



  Introduction:-
  

  This project aimed to clean and transform an Excel dataset to prepare it for analysis. The data contained various errors such as empty cells, incorrect data types, and inconsistent values. This project employed various Excel functions and Power Query to address these issues.


  

  Dataset Description:-

  
  Data Type: [Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xlsx)]
  
  
  Data Size: [Number of rows - 16 and columns in the data- 13]




  Key Challenges in the Data:-

  
  -Empty cells

  
  -Incorrect data types

  
  -Inconsistent values

  
  -Extra line breaks

  
  -Duplicate values    
  




  Tasks Performed:-

  
 
  --Data Exploration: A thorough analysis of the data was conducted to understand the data structure and quality.
 
  
  --Removing Empty Cells: Rows with empty cells were removed to clean the data.
  
  
  --Correcting Data Types: The data types of columns were adjusted to match their actual values.
  
  
  --Removing Extra Line Breaks: Extra line breaks in the address column were removed to streamline the data.
 
  
  --Removing Duplicate Values: Duplicate values in the product price column were removed to correct the data.
  
  
  --Using Power Query: Power Query was used to extract city and pincode from the address column. By using the 'split by delimiter' feature in Power Query, the address column was split to extract the city and pincode.




    
  
  Tools and Techniques Used:-
  
  
  --Excel: Excel was used to clean and transform the data.
  
  
  --Power Query: Power Query was used to transform and model the data.
  
  
  --Excel Functions: Excel functions like IF, SUM, REPLACE, etc. were used.



  Results:-  

  
  This project resulted in a clean and organized dataset that can be used for further analysis.
